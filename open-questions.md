## Q-001 — `gh` CLI auth is invalid; remote default branch still `master`

**Raised:** 2026-04-30
**Blocking:** Sub-agent PR creation (every Phase 0 task after T-FN-MONOREPO),
the GitHub default-branch swap.

**Context:** During Phase 0 bootstrap, the orchestrator renamed the local
branch `master` → `main` and pushed `main` to origin. Two follow-ups
need GitHub-side permissions the sandbox can't perform:

1. The repo's **default branch on GitHub** is still `master`. Sub-agent
   PRs will default to base `master` unless explicitly told `--base main`.
2. The `master` branch can't be deleted on origin until the default
   branch is changed.

`gh auth status` reports: *"The token in keyring is invalid."*

**Options:**

1. **Pablo re-authenticates `gh`** (`gh auth login -h github.com`) in his
   terminal, then the orchestrator runs:
   ```
   gh repo edit pmirandaa/Binderly --default-branch main
   git push origin --delete master
   ```
   — Pros: single ~30s human step, unblocks automated PR creation for
   the entire build. Recommended.
2. **Pablo manually changes the default branch** in the GitHub UI
   (Settings → Branches → switch to `main`, then delete `master`).
   Sub-agents still can't open PRs without `gh` auth, so Pablo would
   also need to manually open every agent PR, or re-auth `gh` later.
3. **Pablo opens every sub-agent PR manually** from the URLs printed
   when sub-agents push their branches. — Pros: zero auth surface for
   the agent. Cons: a few clicks per task × ~109 tasks; tedious.

**Recommendation:** Option 1. The orchestrator will continue dispatching
sub-agents who *push* their branches and print the GitHub
"Create a pull request for `agent/<task-id>`" URL in their completion
summary. Pablo opens those PRs manually until `gh` is re-authed; after
that, sub-agents will use `gh pr create --base main` automatically.

**Pablo's answer:** done with option 1, auth should work

**Orchestrator follow-up (2026-04-30, post-T-FN-CI):** still broken.
`gh auth status` returns:
```
github.com
  X Failed to log in to github.com account pmirandaa (keyring)
  - Active account: true
  - The token in keyring is invalid.
```
Pablo: please re-run `gh auth login -h github.com` (HTTPS, paste a
fresh PAT with `repo` + `workflow` + `admin:public_key` scopes, or
the device-code flow). The orchestrator will run the default-branch
swap + master deletion + `gh pr create` automation as soon as
`gh auth status` returns clean. Until then, the manual
"open this URL to create a PR" loop continues; all 6 merged Phase-0
PRs were opened that way and it's working.

## Q-002 — Docker Desktop daemon not running; T-FN-DOCKER blocked

**Raised:** 2026-04-30
**Blocking:** T-FN-DOCKER (and transitively T-FN-SUPABASE-LOCAL,
T-FN-DB-MIGRATIONS, T-FN-ENV-CONVENTIONS, all of Phase 1).

**Context:** The T-FN-DOCKER sub-agent ran its mandatory pre-flight
(`docker info`) and the daemon refused: *"Cannot connect to the Docker
daemon at unix:///Users/pmiranda/.docker/run/docker.sock"*. The Docker
CLI is installed (v28.3.3, context `desktop-linux`, darwin/arm64), but
Docker Desktop itself isn't running. Per the task's escalation rule the
sub-agent stopped immediately without modifying any files. The worktree
`../binderly-wt-T-FN-DOCKER` and branch `agent/T-FN-DOCKER` are clean
and ready for re-dispatch.

**Options:**

1. **Pablo starts Docker Desktop**, waits for the whale icon to go
   solid, and tells the orchestrator. The orchestrator re-dispatches
   T-FN-DOCKER into the existing clean worktree. Recommended — the
   sub-agent reported it can resume from step 2 with no setup overhead.
2. Skip Docker for now and unblock the chain via a non-Docker Postgres
   (Homebrew). Not recommended — the spec explicitly mandates Docker
   Compose for local-first, zero-cloud-account contributing, and many
   later tasks (image pipeline, MinIO bucket validations) hard-depend
   on the MinIO service.

**Recommendation:** Option 1. T-FN-DOCKER stays in `dependencies.yaml`
with `status: blocked`, `blocked_on: Q-002`. Other Phase 0 tasks
continue dispatching in parallel; Phase 1 will block on this if it
isn't resolved by the time the iteration-3/4 dispatch wants
T-FN-SUPABASE-LOCAL.
